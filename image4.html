    <p>Many people have different preference on animal type. Some people are cat people
     while others can like snakes or some other type of animal. Personally i love dogs and
     Siberian Huskies are my favorite breed of dog. They are nice to look at and they can
     be very friendly and very protective at the same time. Those are the things that you
     ask for out of a dog which makes them the ideal pet.
