     <p>Many people have different preference on animal type. Some people are cat people 
     while others can like snakes or some other type of animal. Personally i love dogs
     and Siberian Huskies are my favorite breed of dog. They are nice to look at and they 
     can be very friendly and very protective at the same time. Those are the things that
     you ask for out of a dog which makes them the ideal pet.
