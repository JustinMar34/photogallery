    <p>Mike Trout is a famous athlete and plays for the Los Angelas Angels of Anaheim.
    He has won two MVP awards and he is only at the age of twenty-five years old. 
    He is well known for respecting the game of baseball and playing the game hard every
    time. By doing this he has earned the respect of the other players and many think he
    is well on his way to a hall of fame career.

     <p>This is a 69 Dodge Charger. This car is a classic and a dream car for many. It 
     has a lot of horse power and it looks beautiful. A fully restored model can go any where 
     from $60,000 and on.

     <p> The grand canyon is a national landmark located in Arizona. It is a wonder how it 
     became so vast and deep but, it is a wonderful sight o see.

     <p>Many people have different preference on animal type. Some people are cat people 
     while others can like snakes or some other type of animal. Personally i love dogs
     and Siberian Huskies are my favorite breed of dog. They are nice to look at and they 
     can be very friendly and very protective at the same time. Those are the things that
     you ask for out of a dog which makes them the ideal pet.

     <p> Vladamir Guerrero is my all time favorite Angels player. He always played the game hard
     and never caused problems for the other players. He would hit mammoth homeruns and had 
     a cannon for an arm. He is on the ballot for the hall of fame this year and many think he will be 
     a first ballot hall of famer.
